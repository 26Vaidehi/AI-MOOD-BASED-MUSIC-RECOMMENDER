🎵 AI Mood-Based Music Recommender
🚀 Bridging Emotions & Music with AI

The AI Mood-Based Music Recommender is an intelligent system that suggests songs based on a user's real-time emotional state. Using cutting-edge AI technologies like NLP, Speech Emotion Recognition, and Computer Vision, it analyzes facial expressions, voice tone, and text input to detect emotions and recommends music that aligns with the user's mood.

🎯 Whether you need motivation for a workout, relaxation after a stressful day, or an uplifting song when you're feeling down—this system personalizes your music experience like never before!

✨ Key Features
✔️ Real-Time Emotion Detection (Facial Expressions, Voice, and Text Analysis)
✔️ Seamless Integration with Music Streaming Services (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music)
✔️ Personalized Mood-Based Playlists
✔️ Multi-Modal AI System (Combines Text, Voice, and Facial Cues)
✔️ Machine Learning for Continuous Improvement
✔️ Supports Mental Well-Being, Productivity, and Fitness Motivation
